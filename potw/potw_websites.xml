		Webs pages are traditionally the standard mechanism for publishing on the web. A collection of these pages will for a website. (Lloyd, 2008).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		An example user of a traditional web page may be a professional photographer to wants to create a portfolio of their work to attract customers or commissioned work.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		He could maybe consider utilising the &lt;acronym title="Application Programming Interface"&gt;API&lt;/acronym&gt; of an online photo publishing website such as Flickr to integrate his photos professionally into his website.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Websites are suited for when you want a professional feel to your online presence and as such are typically preferable over publishing on social networks, more for social interaction than formal presentation,
		&lt;br&gt;or micro blogging services, which is only designed for short publication. Blogs are typically combined within a professional website rather than used on their own.
