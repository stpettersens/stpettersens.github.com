		&lt;h2&gt;Microblogs&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Example user:&lt;/strong&gt; Political activist or dissident. (especially Twitter).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Microblogs are similar in principle in blogs, but for publishing much more concise entries.  Twitter is a good example of a microblogging service.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		On Twitter, users can publish short 140-character messages onto the Twitter service. Twitter can be thought of a cross between a microblogging service and a social network in that users of the service and send replies and send messages directly to other users or refer to them using the @ prefix before their username. (Java et al, 2007).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Twitter, since its launch in October 2004, has become popular with political activists or dissidents in countries with restricted news media. The service has allowed such people to report on the situation in their part of the world which would otherwise remain disclosed or covered up by dictatorship government regimes. Twitter suits this use very well as it allows the quick publish of messages in real time, with support for publishing via mobile phones using either the Web itself directly or via SMS. (Jungherr, 2009).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
